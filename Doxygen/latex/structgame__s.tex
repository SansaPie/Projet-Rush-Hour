\subsection{Detailed Description}
The state of the game is described by the position of the pieces (i.\+e. vehicles) on the board and the number of moves since the beginning of the game. 

The game board is a 6$\ast$6 grid. The lower left corner has coordinates (0,0). The piece number 0 represents the \char`\"{}red car\char`\"{} that needs to be moved away from the parking. Its initial position is (0,3). A winning game (state) is when the red car touches the right border of the game board (i.\+e. when its position is (4,3)).

cgame is a pointer toward a constant game. That means that it is not possible to modify the game thanks to this pointer.
